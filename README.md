# Cheat Sheet for Python Machine Learning and Data Science

Over the past months, I have been gathering all the [cheat sheets for Python, Machine Learning, and Data Science](https://graspcoding.com/cheat-sheet-for-python-machine-learning-and-data-science/). I share them from time to time with teachers, friends, and colleagues, and recently I have been getting asked a lot by some of the followers on Instagram ([@_tech_tutor](https://www.instagram.com/_tech_tutor/) & [@aihub_](https://www.instagram.com/aihub_/)), so I have managed and planned to share the entire cheat sheet collection. To give context and make things more interesting, I have added descriptions/excerpts for each major topic.

_**Note: These cheat sheets have recently been re-designed into Super High-Resolution PDF. These cheat sheets are very helpful as a quick reference for the concepts.**_ ([Full Tutorial])(https://graspcoding.com/cheat-sheet-for-python-machine-learning-and-data-science/)
